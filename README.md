 # SmartPhone Advisor – Sales-Based Phone Recommendation System

SmartPhone Advisor is a web application that helps users make informed phone purchasing decisions based on historical sales trends. It also includes features like a used phone marketplace, phone comparison, phone finder, upcoming phone listings, and user reviews — developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Problem Statement

With the rapid growth in smartphone launches, consumers often face confusion when deciding which phone to purchase. The lack of centralized, data-driven insights and tools for comparing devices, tracking trends, and identifying value-for-money options makes decision-making difficult. Additionally, users lack a reliable platform to buy and sell used smartphones conveniently.
